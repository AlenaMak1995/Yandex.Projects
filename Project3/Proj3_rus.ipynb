    "In this project, data from the Yandex.Real Estate service will be used — an archive of apartment sale listings in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements over several years. The goal is to learn how to determine the market value of real estate properties. The task is to identify parameters that will allow the creation of an automated system: it will detect anomalies and fraudulent activity.\n",

    "* The cheapest apartments are on the first floor - which is understandable: the first floors are usually occupied by various shops and salons, and living in such an environment is not very pleasant, so many prefer to live higher up. However, not on the last floor, since \"another\" floor is more expensive. This can also be related to the fact that on higher floors the water pressure in the pipes can be lower, if the elevator breaks, you will have to walk up very high, but undoubtedly, the view must be beautiful.\n",
    "* The most expensive apartments are sold at the beginning and the end of the year - possibly, this is the peak time for sales - people are eager to start life anew, or receive an annual bonus and start buying apartments. Demand creates supply, and the price may change upwards. In the middle of the year, there's a lull, everyone is on vacation, then it's not the time for apartments.\n",
    "* After experiencing a price peak in 2014, the real estate market slowed down by 2016 - possibly, the global crisis of 2014 had an impact. However, after that, the price started to slowly increase and, undoubtedly, at present could well have beaten the 2014 record."

The prices differ by approximately 4 million, and the ceiling height tends to be 3 meters, which is not surprising since the city center mostly consists of old buildings where ceilings were built to be maximally high.\n",

Unlike the peak prices of 2014 for all apartments, properties in the center only became more expensive by 2016."
